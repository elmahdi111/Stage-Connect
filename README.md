# Stage‑Connect

Stage‑Connect is a web application created to help students from **CMC Pole Tourisme**. The students had a solution for finding internships in hotels, but they didn’t have the skills to build a website themselves. I built this website for them to make their solution accessible and easy to use.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of Stage‑Connect is to provide a **website for students** so they can share their internship-finding solution without needing technical skills.


## 🛠️ Features

- **Student Access:** Browse and view hotel internship offers.  
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage internship offers and student applications.  
- **File Uploads:** Upload documents needed for applications.  
- **Pre-built Pages:** Login, signup, application forms, and admin interface.
